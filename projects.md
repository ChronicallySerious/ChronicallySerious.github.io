<img src="/assets/rootex.png" width=100em>

**Rootex Engine** is an advanced 3D game engine written in C++ made by a small team which I am leading at a programming club named [SDSLabs at IIT Roorkee](https://sdslabs.co/){:target="_blank"}. Rootex is supporting a work-in-progress game, which is planned to be released in 2021. It comes with an editor written also in C++ using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui){:target="_blank"}.

**Google Summer of Code 2019** is a program conducted by Google which allows open-source organization to hire students to work on their projects related to the organization for around 3 months. This program is sponsored by Google.

My proposal for adding a version control system integration was selected by the [Godot Engine organization](https://godotengine.org/){:target="_blank"} which maintains the fully-featured and fully open-sourced C++ based game engine. I am now maintaining the VCS integration feature in the Godot Engine organization.

## [Rubeus 2D Game Engine](/2020/08/03/rubeus-engine/)

<img src="/assets/rubeus.png" width=250em>

**Rubeus Engine** is a simple, cross-platform, 2D game engine written in C++17 using OpenGL 3.3. The main objective of making this engine is to provide a simple and fast API to help people realize their game ideas efficiently. I was the original author of the v1.0 release.

## [G for Golf Game + VR Edition](/2020/08/02/g-for-golf/)

<img src="/assets/g_for_golf.png" width=250em>

**G for Golf** is a golf game but with a twist. The player controls the ball's gravity and not the ball directly, which means they have the complete control of the ball in 3D space.

**Also I have VR edition for this game**, which won prizes in multiple hackathons and exhibitions. Created in Unreal Engine 4.
