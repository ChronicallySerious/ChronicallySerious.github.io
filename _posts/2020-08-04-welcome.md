Hello, I am Twarit Waikar, currently doing my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (expected 2021). You can see my resume [here](/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I quite like reading about operating systems, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and general systems programming.

You can look at my projects [here](/projects). If you like them then [let's get in touch](/contact)!

Also I am a part of IIT Roorkee's programming group known as [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/){:target="_blank"} where we build all our large-scale projects and IIT Roorkee's technical magazine group called [Geek Gazette](https://geekgazette.iitr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I usually help them design their magazines.
