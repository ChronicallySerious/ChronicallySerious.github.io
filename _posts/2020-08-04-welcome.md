Hello, I am Twarit Waikar. Currently I am working at Salesforce as a software engineer and I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. You can view my resume [here](/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I quite like reading about operating systems, cloud, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and also just high performance low level systems programming in general.

You can look at my projects [here](/projects). If you like them then [let's get in touch](/contact)!

During my time in college, I was a part of IIT Roorkee's software development group known as [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/){:target="_blank"} from 2018 to 2021 where we built large-scale team projects covering a wide variety of domains like game engines, web portals, cloud management and deployment systems, etc. I was also a designer in IIT Roorkee's technical magazine group called [Geek Gazette](https://geekgazette.iitr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I usually helped them design magazines.
