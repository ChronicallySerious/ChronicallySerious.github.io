**G for Golf** is a golf game but with a twist. The player controls the ball's gravity and not the ball directly, which means they have the complete control of the ball in 3D space.

**Also I have VR edition for this game**, which won prizes in multiple hackathons and exhibitions.

The game was released with 3 levels. And each level explored a different aspect of the game design possibilities in this idea.
