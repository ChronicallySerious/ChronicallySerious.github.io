I"Ø<p>Hello, I am Twarit Waikar.</p>

<p>Hello, I am Twarit Waikar, currently doing my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (expected 2021). You can see my resume <a href="/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In my free time I work on my projects and read about operating systems, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and general systems programming.</p>

<p>I am a part of IIT Roorkeeâ€™s programming group known as <a href="sdslabs.co" target="_blank">SDSLabs</a> where we build all our large-scale projects and IIT Roorkeeâ€™s technical magazine group called <a href="https://geekgazette.iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank">Geek Gazette</a> where I usually help them design their magazines.</p>

<p>During the past few years I have internship in the field of cloud infrastructure management and simulations based on road traffic.</p>

<p>I worked on a driving simulator with Unreal Engine 4 (during my internship at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business solutions, Bangalore) which had realistic traffic rules integrated into it using third-party traffic simulators.</p>

<p>On my next internship I worked on reducing the cost of public cloud infrastructure being used at a team in Salesforce, partly in India and partly in USA. I was given the responsibility of coming up with a framework that can detect and report unused, unclassified, unlabeled cloud resources in AWS and GCP.</p>
