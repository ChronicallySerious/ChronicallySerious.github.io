<p><strong>Rootex Engine</strong> is an advanced 3D game engine written in C++ made by a small team which I am leading at a programming club named <a href="https://sdslabs.co/" target="_blank">SDSLabs at IIT Roorkee</a>. Rootex is supporting a work-in-progress game, which is planned to be released in 2021. It comes with an editor written also in C++ using <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">Dear ImGui</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Google Summer of Code 2019</strong> is a program conducted by Google which allows open-source organization to hire students to work on their projects related to the organization for around 3 months. This program is sponsored by Google.</p>

<p>My proposal for adding a version control system integration in the Godot Editor similar to the ones in popular text editors was selected into Godot Engine organization which maintains the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Game engine</a></p>

<p><img src="/assets/rubeus.png" width="250em" /></p>

<p><strong>Rubeus Engine</strong> is a simple, cross-platform, 2D game engine written in C++17 using OpenGL 3.3. The main objective of making this engine is to provide a simple and fast API to help people realize their game ideas efficiently. I was the original author of the v1.0 release.</p>

<h2 id="g-for-golf-game--vr-edition"><a href="/2020/08/02/g-for-golf/">G for Golf Game + VR Edition</a></h2>

<p><img src="/assets/g_for_golf.png" width="250em" /></p>

<p><strong>G for Golf</strong> is a golf game but with a twist. The player controls the ballâ€™s gravity and not the ball directly, which means they have the complete control of the ball in 3D space.</p>

<p><strong>Also I have VR edition for this game</strong>, which won prizes in multiple hackathons and exhibitions. Created in Unreal Engine 4.</p>
