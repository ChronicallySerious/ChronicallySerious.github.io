I"Ú<p>Hello, I am Twarit Waikar.</p>

<p>I am currently doing my â€˜Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineeringâ€™ degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (expected 2021). You can see my resume <a href="/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>I quite like reading about operating systems, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and general systems programming.</p>

<p>I also like listening to FutureBass and lo-fi music :)</p>
