<p><strong>Rootex Engine</strong> is an advanced 3D game engine written in C++ made by a small team which I am leading at a programming club named <a href="https://sdslabs.co/" target="_blank">SDSLabs at IIT Roorkee</a>. Rootex is supporting a work-in-progress game, which is planned to be released in 2021. It comes with an editor written also in C++ using <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui" target="_blank">Dear ImGui</a>.</p>

<p>Rootex uses a modified version of the Entity-Component-System architecture, now popular in the game development world because its ease of use, modularity and performance boost thanks to better CPU cache usage.</p>

<p>Rootex uses DirectX 11 as its rendering backend and we keep adding rendering effects to it like dynamic phong lighting, particles effects, etc.</p>
