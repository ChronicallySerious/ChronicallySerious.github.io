<p><strong>G for Golf</strong> is a golf game but with a twist. The player controls the ballâ€™s gravity and not the ball directly, which means they have the complete control of the ball in 3D space.</p>

<p><strong>Also I have VR edition for this game</strong>, which won prizes in multiple hackathons and exhibitions. Created in Unreal Engine 4.</p>

<p>The game was released with 3 levels. And each level explored a different aspect of the game design possibilities in this idea.</p>
