<p><strong>Rubeus Engine</strong> is a simple, cross-platform, 2D game engine written in C++17 using OpenGL 3.3. The main objective of making this engine is to provide a simple and fast API to help people realize their game ideas efficiently.</p>

<p>I was the original author of the v1.0 release.</p>

<p>Rubeus uses <a href="https://github.com/sdslabs/broCLI">broCLI</a>, a Go based CLI tool that helps create the project structure for using Rubeus. broCLI was later superceded by a separate project manager released with Rubeus v2.0.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.sdslabs.co/2018/12/making-a-game-engine-from-scratch" target="_blank">Rubeus v1.0 was released</a> on 22nd December 2018 and around 10 months later on October 13th 2019, <a href="https://blog.sdslabs.co/2019/10/announcing-rubeus-engine-2" target="_blank">Rubeus v2.0 was launched</a>.</p>
