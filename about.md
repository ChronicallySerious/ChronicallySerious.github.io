Hello, I am Twarit Waikar.

I am currently doing my Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (expected 2021). You can see my resume [here](/assets/Twarit_Waikar_Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

In my free time I work on my projects and read about operating systems, computer graphics, game development (including virtual reality), and general systems programming.

I am a part of IIT Roorkee's programming group known as [SDSLabs](sdslabs.co){:target="_blank"} where we build all our large-scale projects and IIT Roorkee's technical magazine group called [Geek Gazette](https://geekgazette.iitr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I usually help them design their magazines.

During the past few years I have done internships in the field of cloud infrastructure management and simulations based on road traffic.

I worked on a driving simulator with Unreal Engine 4 (during my internship at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business solutions, Bangalore) which had realistic traffic rules integrated into it using third-party traffic simulators.

On my next internship I worked on reducing the cost of public cloud infrastructure being used at a team in Salesforce, partly in India and partly in USA. I was given the responsibility of coming up with a framework that can detect and report unused, unclassified, unlabeled cloud resources under their projects hosted on AWS and GCP.

Since then I have been shifting my focus onto more generalised systems design and development related fields by working on my side-projects. **To know more about my personal projects, take a look [here](/projects).**
